This FilmQuery project was developed as a part of my Java learning experience. It's designed to showcase my understanding of Java fundamentals, database interaction, and object-oriented programming. Feel free to dive into the code, explore, and connect with me for any insights or discussions!

## Description
The FilmQuery Application is a Java-based console program that allows users to interact with a film database. This project demonstrates my skills in Java programming, especially in handling database operations, user input, and data presentation.

Users can search for films by their ID or a keyword and receive detailed information about each film, including its title, description, release year, language, and cast.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the Java files from the repository.
2. Compile and run the FilmQueryApp.java file.
3. The user will be presented with a menu to:
	1. Look up a film by its ID.
	2. Search for a film by a keyword.
	3. Exit the application.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to explore film details.

## Technologies Used
- The program uses Java's `java.util.Scanner` class for user input.
- Java 1.8
- Eclipse IDE
- JUnit 5
- JDBC API
- MySQL

## Lessons Learned
- Database Connectivity: Implementing JDBC to connect and interact with a MySQL database.
- SQL Query Design: Crafting SQL queries to fetch and manipulate data based on user input.
- Object-Oriented Programming: Creating classes and objects to model real-world entities like films and actors.
- User Interface Design: Developing a console-based user interface to facilitate user interaction.
- Exception Handling: Managing SQL exceptions and ensuring the application runs smoothly.


## Usage Examples
- Search by Film ID
Input: Film ID 1
Output: Film details including title, year, rating, description, language, and cast.

- Search by Keyword
Input: Keyword love
Output: List of films with 'keyword' and details including title, year, rating, description, language, and cast.
